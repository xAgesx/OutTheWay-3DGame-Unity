NEW Game IDEA : PenguinAvalanche
 
a player trying to dodge rolling obstacles coming from a slope , move left and right to dodge , use powerUps (jump , SlowMo , lives ...) in order to survive 
as long as possible and get a new high score .

>- Make character using rigidbody ( movement and collision ) 
>- Make Ground ( slope and add invisible edges for obstacles )
>- Generate random obstacles rolling down (make obstacles scale up as they rolldown)
>- Add PowerUps 
>- Add Death ( maybe Time stops )
>- Add sfx and Animations + Textures and mats 
>- Add online Leaderboard
 - Add more maps
 - Add more characters 
 - Add more powerups
>- Fix Bugs ( online only )
 - Clean code ( Add try catch , refactor functions , remove Debugging Logs)

=-=-=-= Release =-=-=-=
- fix pause after slowmotion , the player gets too fast
>- powerups don't stop
>- quit in pause menu then start game won't work , deltaTime = 0
